php-urlbuilder-form
===================

It is the script which give you the UI interface to edit an URL parameters and build an updated URL.

Often you find yourself stuck with a very long URL with lot of get parameters and you want to test the same URL with different values in the query params.
It becomes tedious to edit a URL in the address bar by moving your cursor left and right to find the appropriate key value pair and update it.

This script takes the URL as an input, which will be parsed and the form will be generated accordingly with the text fields to edit.
And will output the new updated URL which you can simple click on to see the new results.
